Todos are currently marked in the files themselves but here is a list of
what needs to happen:

* Hmm.scala
  - Come up with some better names than currTrellis and prev Trellis

o Hmm.scala/forward
   - I need to make the algorithm robust to underflow (scaling?)

o Hmm.scala/decode
   - Work in log-space (to avoid underflow)

* Hmm.scala
   - write unit tests for functions:
     forward: build N random Hmms; generate sequences from each; test to make
     	      sure that, using forward, each sequence is most likely to have
	      come from the Hmm that generated it
   - decode:  Design a unit test here...

o Hmm.scala
   - Implement a learning algorithm for learning parameters (i.e. transition
     and observation matrices)

* Hmm.scala
   - Implement Baum-welch learning algorithm

* Hmm.scala
  - Make code more functional (avoid all of those nasty while loops)

* Hmm.scala
  - Add assertions to check pre/post conditions and invariants

* Hmm.scala/inverseSample
  - Have it error out if it going through the while loop without returning

* Hmm.scala
  - Implement using scalala

o ML-Scala
  - Build project with sbt
