Todos are currently marked in the files themselves but here is a list of
what needs to happen:

0) Hmm.scala
   - Come up with some better names than currTrellis and prev Trellis

1) Hmm.scala/forward
   - I need to make the algorithm robust to underflow (scaling?)

2) Hmm.scala/decode
   - Work in log-space (to avoid underflow)

3) Hmm.scala
   - write unit tests for functions:
     forward: build N random Hmms; generate sequences from each; test to make
     	      sure that, using forward, each sequence is most likely to have
	      come from the Hmm that generated it
   - decode:  Design a unit test here...

4) Hmm.scala
   - Implement a learning algorithm for learning parameters (i.e. transition
     and observation matrices)
